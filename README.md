# Portfolio Landing Page 🛬

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is my portfolio which introduces me and my work.
I wanted it to be modern and SEO-friendly so I thought the landing page format would be the best fit for that. 🛬  
You can switch language by clicking on the 🇬🇧/🇯🇵 flag in the navbar.  
Special thanks to [Noelie Karoum](https://noeliekaroumportfolio.com/) who designed the UI.
